# My 2017 Year in Review

I’m not one to make New Year’s resolutions, but I do like to reflect on the year that just passed. I’ve been doing this for a few years now, and I think it’s a great way to look back and see how far I’ve come. This year was a little different, though. I had a lot of changes happen in my life this year, and I think it’s important to reflect on them. So, here’s my 2017 year in review.

## 2017 Year in Review: The Big Changes

I started the year by moving to a new city. I moved to San Francisco in January, and I’ve been here ever since. I’ve been loving it so far, and I’m excited to see what the new year has in store for me here.

I also got a new job. I started working at a startup in March, and I’ve been loving it. I’ve learned a lot in my time here, and I’m excited to see what the new year has in store for me here.

## 2017 Year in Review: The Good

I got to travel a lot this year. I went to San Francisco, Las Vegas, New York City, and Austin. I also went to a few smaller cities in California, like San Jose and San Luis Obispo. I’ve never traveled this much in a year, and I’m glad I was able to do it.

I also got to visit my family in Florida. I haven’t been home in a while, and I’m glad I was able to go home this year. I’m looking forward to going home again next year.

## 2017 Year in Review: The Bad

I had some health issues this year. I had a few instances of bronchitis and a few instances of strep. I also had to get a few teeth pulled. I’m glad I’m feeling better now, but I’m not looking forward to having to go to the dentist again next year.

I also had a few issues with my car this year. My car broke down a few times, and I had to get a few things fixed. I’m glad I was able to get everything

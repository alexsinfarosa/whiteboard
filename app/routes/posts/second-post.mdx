Python 3.9 introduced a new `with` statement that allows you to use a context manager as a function. This is a very useful feature that allows you to write more concise code. In this article, we will see how to use it.

## The `with` statement

The `with` statement is used to execute a block of code with a context manager. A context manager is an object that defines the runtime context to be established when executing a `with` statement. It is a very useful feature that allows you to write more concise code. For example, you can use it to open a file and close it automatically when you are done with it.

```python

with open("file.txt") as f:
    print(f.read())

```

The `with` statement is very useful when you need to open a file, read it, and close it. However, it is not very useful when you need to open a file, read it, and return the content of the file. In this case, you need to use a `try`/`finally` block.

```python

try:
    f = open("file.txt")
    print(f.read())
finally:
    f.close()

```
